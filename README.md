# Log-Analyzer
## 📌 Project Overview

Modern applications generate massive amounts of logs that are crucial for performance monitoring, debugging, and security auditing. However, manually analyzing these logs is time-consuming and error-prone.

This project automates log parsing and analysis using **Python** and **pandas**, supporting operations like:
- Counting logs by severity
- Filtering logs based on a time range
- Viewing specific log entries
