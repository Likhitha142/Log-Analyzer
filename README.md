#  Log Analyzer

## 📌 Project Overview

Modern software systems continuously generate extensive logs that are essential for tracking application behavior, identifying performance issues, and securing systems. However, due to their large volume and complexity, analyzing these logs manually can be time-consuming and inefficient.

The Log Analyzer tool simplifies this task by automating the parsing, filtering, and inspection of log data using Python. It enables users to quickly derive insights from log files without requiring advanced technical knowledge.
